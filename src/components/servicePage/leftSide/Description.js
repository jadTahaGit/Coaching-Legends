        *Want a 45-mins sample session? Message me for a $10 Custom Offer*
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>
          IMPORTANT: The longer you work with me the better results you can
          expect
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        With 4 sessions you WILL see how to become a better version of yourself.
        But do you think your life can change in just 4 weeks?
        <br />
        <br />
        That’s not how it works. The process of transformation takes time,
        period.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are TRULY committed to becoming the PEAK version of yourself…
        Then it’s a no brainer:
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>
          Either subscribe for 3 or 6 months (Subscribe To Save button is
          located under the price)
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        The more committed you are to yourself the longer you should subscribe
        to your favorite package.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you order the Premium package and subscribe for 6 months, you can
        become a whole different person by the end of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        All I need from you is commitment, patience, dedication & consistency.
        If you are coachable, I will guide you exactly where you need to go to.
        <br />
        <br />
        But YOU are the one who must take the path I guide you towards. I’m
        “just” your guide who can get you to your goals faster
        <br />
        <br />
