When I’m cycling, I find that I get a lot of really useful thinking done. My mind seems to float free of everyday worries that normally peck at me like ducks. When I’m in the saddle and racing along, I find myself more easily able to take a big-picture view.\n                        </p>\n                        <div className=\"devider\">\n                            <hr />\n                        </div>\n                        <p>\n                            I think it has to do with the curious balance between (a the demands that cycling places on my mind and body and b) the freedoms that it imparts. There’s something alchemical going on that catalyzes a truly useful mental state, and one that’s qualitatively different from when I’m sitting at home, reading, walking, or talking to other people.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            <ul className=\"blog__list\">\n                                <li>That means there’s lots of mental room for active thinking</li>\n                                <li>I can pick something that’s specifically bugging me</li>\n                                <li>Even short errands tend to give me 15 minutes of cycling; meeting someone in Manhattan for lunch often means an hour and a half of cycling during a business day</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </p>\n                        <div className=\"devider\">\n                            <hr />\n                        </div>\n                        <p>\n                            In the rest of my life, I rarely spend that much time only thinking. If I’m sitting around the house, I might spend some minutes staring into space, pondering something. But more likely than not I’d flip open my laptop to do some reading, or I’d look at a book or a magazine, or I’d dork around on social media. Obviously, if I’m reading something deep or informative, I’m doing a lot of useful thinking there, too. But it’s cognitive work that’s triggered by media.\n                            But with cycling, you cannot seriously consume visual media at all. You can peek at your phone during a stop light, or riskily glance at a message while zipping along an empty street. (Dangerous; one shouldn’t do it; yet I sometimes do.)\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            To be clear, this is just a pulled-outta-my-hat analysis of what cycling seems to do to my brain. Your experience may be different. But whatever it is, let me know in the comments — I’d be intrigued to hear!\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target={\"_blank\"}>Learn more</a>\n                        </p>\n                        <div className=\"write__comment\">\n                            <textarea rows={\"5\"} className=\"write__comment__control\" placeholder=\"Write a comment...\"></textarea>\n                            <input type=\"button\" className=\"btn__primary\" value=\"Submit\" />\n                            <div className=\"comments__block\">\n                                <div className=\"comment__element\">\n                                    <div className=\"comment__header\">\n                                        <img src={woman1} alt=\"Comment Avatar\" className=\"comment__avatar\" />\n                                        <div className=\"comment__coach__info\">\n                                            <h4 className=\"coach__name\">Lorem Ipsum</h4>\n                                            <span className=\"comment__time\">6 days ago</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div className=\"comment__body\">\n                                        In the rest of my life, I rarely spend that much time only thinking.
